# CI/CD - What? Why? When? How?
## What is CI/CD?
- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
-  It is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository which is called continuous integration, and then automatically deploying those changes to production or other environments, which is called continuous deployment.
## Why should we use CI/CD?
CI/CD has numerous benefits:
  - Maximized creativity and efficiency in software development and release.
  - Higher efficiency and increased productivity.
  - Reduced risk of defects.
  - Faster product delivery.
  - Quick rollback if issues arise.
  - Automation reduces costs.
  - Fault isolation.
  - Accelerated release rate.
## When is CI/CD appropriate?
There are various situations where the implementation of CI/CD is not only appropriate but also essential:
   - Team Collaboration
     - Teams may be impelmenting frequent code changes
   - Automated testing
   - Fast and Reliable deployment
   - Continous approach
     - CI/CD uses a continous feedback loop where the development, testing, and operations teams are linked. This allows for issues to be quickly solved.
