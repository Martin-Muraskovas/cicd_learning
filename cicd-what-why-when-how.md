# CI/CD - What? Why? When? How?
## What is CI/CD?
- CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment.
-  It is a software development practice that aims to automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository which is called continuous integration, and then automatically deploying those changes to production or other environments, which is called continuous deployment.
## Why should we use CI/CD?
CI/CD has numerous benefits:
  - Maximized creativity and efficiency in software development and release.
  - Higher efficiency and increased productivity.
  - Reduced risk of defects.
  - Faster product delivery.
  - Quick rollback if issues arise.
  - Automation reduces costs.
  - Fault isolation.
  - Accelerated release rate.
## When is CI/CD appropriate?
There are various situations where the implementation of CI/CD is not only appropriate but also essential:
   - Team Collaboration
     - Teams may be impelmenting frequent code changes
   - Automated testing
   - Fast and Reliable deployment
   - Continous approach
     - CI/CD uses a continous feedback loop where the development, testing, and operations teams are linked. This allows for issues to be quickly solved.
## How can CI/CD be implemented?



## What is a Webhook?
A webhook is an HTTP-based callback function that allows lightweight, event-driven communication between two applications.

Webhooks are triggered by specific events and send data from one application to another.

They are commonly used to automate processes, such as sending notifications, updating data, or triggering actions in response to events.


## What is the difference between delivery and deployment in producation?
In software development, delivery refers to the process of making the software available for testing or release. 

Deployment includes activities such as configuring the software, setting up the necessary infrastructure, and ensuring that the software runs smoothly in the production environment.
